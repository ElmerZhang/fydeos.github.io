## 1. Package manager of FydeOS

Please note that this refers to FydeOS itself, not Linux (beta). In theory, you have two package managers you can use, one is chromebrew specially developed for the Chromium OS system, and the other is Apt, which is common in Linux distributions. Naturally, due to various limitations of Chromium OS itself, the use of Apt requires manual copy and installation of Apt itself and its dependent files, and the need to "pseudo package" to meet all the dependencies of Apt, so this article only introduces the installation method of chromebrew.

## 2. How to install

You can install chromebrew in the following ways:

 - Use Ctrl + Alt + t to open the terminal and enter the shell
 - Then enter and run the following script:
 ```
 curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash
 ```

In principle, you may need to enter the FydeOS administrator account password, but since FydeOS for PC v6.0, the system will no longer set the initial password for the default chronos user. After a period of downloading and installation (it may take about 10 minutes, depending on your network conditions), chromebrew can be used in your FydeOS.

## 3. How to use

The following are the common methods of using chromebrew:

 - Install the software package: `crew install *package name*`
 - Uninstall the software package: `crew remove *package name*`
 - Upgrade all packages to the latest version: `crew upgrade`
 - Query help: `crew help`

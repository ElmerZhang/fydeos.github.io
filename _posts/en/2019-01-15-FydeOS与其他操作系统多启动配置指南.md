> Note: This tutorial assumes that you are not new to the daily operations of multiple operating systems and have the most basic familiarity. If you find the following content difficult to understand, please seek the help of friends around you or go to [FydeOS Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) for help.


## 0. Preparation
#### Suitable

This tutorial is suitable for users who want to install FydeOS as a **second system** into the computer, that is, the target device already has a preferred operating system that can run and can complete basic disk operations.

#### System Requirements

 - One 64-bit PC, need to support UEFI and start in UEFI mode (CSM mode can be turned on or off)
 - The main operating system that can run normally, such as macOS, Windows or any Linux distribution.
 - The hard disk is partitioned in GPT mode with at least 10GB of free space
 - FydeOS for PC v5.3 and above


## 1. Make room for FydeOS

You need to free up at least 10G of free disk space for FydeOS to be installed and partition it. Note that this space must exist as a **primary partition**. The following content shows the operation demonstration on the mainstream operating system:

#### 1.1. Windows system (using Windows 10 as an example)

 - Find "This Computer" in the Windows 10 interface, right-click it, and select "Manage":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step1.png)

 - Find "Storage" - "Disk Management" on the left side of the "Management" interface that pops up; you can open the disk management component that comes with Windows, as shown below:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step2.png)

 - If you currently only have one main partition (C drive under Windows) and there is enough free space, you need to split a part of the space from this main partition to FydeOS. Right-click the main partition that needs to be split, and select "Compress" from the pop-up options menu:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step3.png)

 - Fill in the size of the space to be vacated in the compression option that pops up immediately. In order to make FydeOS run smoothly afterwards, we recommend at least 20G of space. The number unit to be filled in here is MB. In the example in the figure below, about 50G of space will be split from the main partition. After filling in, click "compress". **Note: For easier identification of specific partitions in the next steps, we recommend that the capacity of the new partition should be different from the capacity of the main partition.**
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step4.png)

 - It can be seen that there is more free space split in the previous step in the partition legend. We now need to use this remaining space to create a new partition. Right click on it and select "New Simple Volume":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step5.png)

 - In the option menu of "Specify Volume Size", just keep the default:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step6.png)

 - In the option menu of "Assign drive letter and path", select "Do not assign drive letter or drive path":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step7_1.png)

 - In the option menu of "Format Partition", just keep the default:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/step8.png)

 - After completing the above steps, Disk Manager will create a new partition for you, as shown in the figure below. The disk for FydeOS is now ready.

#### 1.2. MacOS system (take macOS 10.13 High Sierra as an example)
We can use the "Disk Utility" (Disk Utility) that comes with the system to shrink the existing partition and create a new partition using the free space obtained.

 - Find and start "Disk Utility" in "Utilities" or "Launchpad":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/osx1.png)

 - Click the "Partition" button in the top functional area of ​​"Disk Utility"; by default, macOS will place the used partition into the "APFS container" and encourage users to create a new "APFS volume". Since installing a new operating system really needs to modify the partition table, select "Partition" in the following dialog box that pops up:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/osx2.png)

 - Click "+" below the pie chart and fill in the name, format and size of the partition to be added in the pop-up dialog box. Among them, we recommend "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"; in order to make FydeOS run smoothly afterwards, we recommend at least 20G of space. **Note: For easier identification of specific partitions in the next steps, we recommend that the capacity of the new partition should be different from the capacity of the main partition.**
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/osx3.png)

 - Click "Apply", the program will summarize the changes just made and let you finally confirm. After confirming that it is correct, click "Partition":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/osx4.png)

 - It may take a while for "Disk Utility" to perform the above operations. After everything is completed, click "Finish" and the disk for FydeOS will be created.

#### 1.3. Linux system
If you will use Linux, you should not need additional instructions: p


## 2. Boot FydeOS via USB

Use [this tutorial](https://fydeos.com/instructions-pc/) to put FydeOS into the mobile storage device and use it to boot the system. After the system starts, the welcome screen for the first run will appear, guiding you through some basic setup work, please cooperate with it. This process can ensure that FydeOS runs well on the target device without obvious hardware compatibility issues.


## 3. Complete the installation of FydeOS on a separate partition through the "Installer" program

 - After entering the FydeOS desktop and keeping the Internet connected for a few minutes, FydeOS will automatically download and install several required components, including the "FydeOS App Store". Run the "FydeOS App Store" from the program manager, you can find the "Installer" program, click "Add to FydeOS" to install it:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/install1-1.png)

 - After the FydeOS installer starts, select "Multi-boot installation":
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/install2.png)

 - Select the target disk in the "Disk" drop-down menu in "Select System Partition" in the upper left corner. The installer will automatically recognize the mobile storage device that FydeOS is currently running and disable this option. In the following example, `mmcblk0` is the target disk; the remaining `mmcblk0 ****` is the extra partition on the disk, which can be ignored:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/install3.png)

 - Select the target partition from the "Partition" drop-down menu in "Select System Partition" in the upper right corner. The installer will automatically recognize the size of the target partition. With the steps in "Make Partition for FydeOS" just now, you can use this to reconfirm whether it is the correct target partition. **Note: Please make sure that the target partition is the partition where you expect to install FydeOS, because the following steps will completely clear all data under the partition. If you are unsure, please do not continue.**
 - After completion, you can continue to complete the "Select EFI Partition". Normally, the disk of the EFI partition is the same as the disk of the system partition; in the "Partition" drop-down menu of the "EFI partition", the installer will automatically recognize the EFI partition according to the situation and disable other incorrect options.

 - If your system is not installed with a multi-OS boot manager program, we have prepared [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) for you, just turn on the "Install rEFInd" switch, The installer will automatically help you complete the program settings.
 - Click "Install", the installation program will prompt again, after confirming that it is correct, please click "Confirm" to continue:
![](https://fydeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/install5.png)

 - When the installation script is running, you can see related progress tips. Depending on the read and write speed of the disk, the entire installation process may be relatively long. The waiting time of up to about 30 minutes is normal, please be patient:

 - After everything is completed, click "Restart":

## 4. Switch Operating System
If the above installation operations are performed correctly, you will enter the rEFInd operating system selection screen after your device restarts. You can use the keyboard to select the operating system you want to use. We have added icons to FydeOS for your convenience. If you don't choose, rEFInd will load the last selected operating system by default after a few seconds.

If you did not choose to install rEFInd in the previous step, or you have already installed other operating system boot managers before, you need to set it yourself.


## 5. FAQ

> How long does it take to install?

Under normal circumstances, about 10 minutes or so, depending on the speed of the disk and USB boot device, there will be some fluctuations.

<br>

> Will the installation process delete or modify the data on my disk

The installer will reformat the partition of the drive you specified, so all the files on the partition will be lost; the installer will also modify some files in the EFI partition to add the operating system boot manager and related setting options. In addition, the installation program will not modify or delete files on other partitions.

**Note: This installer and the script to be executed are still in the early testing stage. Although we make every effort to test and guarantee its stability, we cannot be held jointly and severally liable for any data loss caused by our omissions. Please do your own data backup.**

<br>

> After the multi-boot configuration is completed, does the system support OTA upgrade?

Yes.

<br>

> What if something goes wrong?

Since this multi-start solution and the above-mentioned software tools are still in the early testing stage, in some cases, the installation process may have errors. After the installer detects an error, it will automatically stop the installation process and prompt basic error messages.

You can go to [FydeOS Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) for help, and provide detailed error information, hardware information and related operations.

Even if an error occurs during the installation process, in theory the installer will not modify any data on your other disks, so the original operating system will not be affected. You can restart your device, start the previous operating system, delete the partition and merge the free space thus obtained into the main partition to undo the above operations.

<br>

> After FydeOS is installed, can I install other OS?

Sure, but you have to manually compress the existing partition to make room for the new operating system. Or, delete the partitions of other previous OSs and create partitions for the new OS.

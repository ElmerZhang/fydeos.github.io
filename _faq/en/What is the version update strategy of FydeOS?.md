In principle, the core version of FydeOS will maintain an interval of no more than 2 major versions with the upstream projects Chromium OS and the stable version of Google Chrome OS. For example, if the current stable version of Google Chrome OS is `70.0.*.*`, In the worst case, FydeOS will remain at `68.0.*.*`.

The small-scale fixes in the version will be released from time to time, and the patch team will be issued as soon as they encounter important security related issues.

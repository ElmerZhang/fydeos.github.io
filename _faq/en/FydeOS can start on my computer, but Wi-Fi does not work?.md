We are working hard to improve Wi-Fi compatibility. If you find that Wi-Fi does not work on your computer after startup, you can try to go back to the first page at startup and switch the Wi-Fi driver through "Advanced Settings". Restart the computer after completion, the system will start another set of drivers we prepared for Broadcom based wireless card chip. If your computer uses the wireless network card chip provided by Broadcom, then the problem of Wi-Fi not working after switching can be solved.

If you still can't solve the Wi-Fi problem, please post in the community and leave your computer's Wi-Fi chip brand and model, we will try our best to adapt the chip in future releases.

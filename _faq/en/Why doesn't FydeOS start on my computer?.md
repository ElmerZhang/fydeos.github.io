**FydeOS for PC is still an earlier version. This means that FydeOS has not yet run perfectly on every computer in the world. And in use, you may also find that it still has technical problems, inadequacies and lack of functionality.**

FydeOS (and its upstream project Chromium OS) is different from other traditional Linux distributions. It is highly optimized and integrated into the browser's graphics stack technology (including the underlying graphics driver, hardware acceleration module, and user mode window manager module), which provides higher performance and user experience for FydeOS, but also limits hardware compatibility.

If you find that FydeOS fails to run on your computer for various reasons and needs help, please post to our [Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) for help and provide as much detail as possible about you Configuration information, we and the fans in the community will help you answer as soon as possible.

Finally, stay tuned for our upcoming hardware products specifically built for FydeOS.

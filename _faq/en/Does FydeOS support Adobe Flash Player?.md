In the latest FydeOS for PC version, we have embedded Adobe Flash Player, which you can use directly.

In addition, Adobe Flash Player will gradually be eliminated by mainstream browsers due to its closed design and lack of security and will eventually stop updating. If you are still using a website or program that relies heavily on Flash technology, it is recommended that you replace it as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, FydeOS cannot fully adapt to the computer equipment you are using. If you want our help, please:

 - Try to run traditional Linux distributions such as Ubuntu on your device, compare and record the adaptation.
 - Describe in detail the hardware-related information that cannot be adapted, including the brand model of the hardware, whether it can be supported under other Linux distributions, related driver information, etc.
 - Send the above content to our [Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) in detail, waiting for our technical support to give you feedback and help.

We are very sorry that we cannot make any commitment to adaptation for individual users, but we will do our best to support it if we receive a sufficiently detailed application for adaptation.

At present, a virtual machine version adapted to VMware has been launched. You can visit [download page](https://fydeos.com/download/), download and try it. It should be noted that this virtual machine image can only be adapted to VMWare Workstation Pro 15, Workstation Player 15 and WMWare Fusion 11. If you want to get the best experience, we still recommend you to use FydeOS for PC or FydeOS for You version.

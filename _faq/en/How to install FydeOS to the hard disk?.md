After booting from a USB storage medium, confirm that the compatibility of FydeOS on your hardware device is sufficient to meet the requirements. To avoid booting from USB storage media every time, you can install FydeOS for PC to the hard disk.

At present, we provide two installation solutions, one is ["full disk installation"](https://faq.fydeos.com/en/getting-started/install-fydeos-to-hdd/), another is ["operating system multi-boot installation"](https://faq.fydeos.com/en/recipes/dual-boot/). It should be emphasized that these tutorials assume that you are no stranger to the daily operations of multiple operating systems and have the most basic familiarity. If you find these tutorials difficult to understand, please seek the help of friends around you or go to [FydeOS Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) for help. If you are not sure about your operation, please do not continue.

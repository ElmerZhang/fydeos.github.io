Through testing, we found that FydeOS booted from a mobile storage device will be greatly affected by performance. If you want to get the best experience, you can try to install FydeOS into the hard disk.

In addition, different storage media have a huge impact on the user experience.

We recommend using the following two brands of SD card and USB disk to program FydeOS. Of course, if you have a better choice, you can also recommend it to us.

* SD card: Samsung EVO Plus 32GB SD card is a good choice with high cost performance
* USB disk: SanDisk Extreme Pro USB 3.0

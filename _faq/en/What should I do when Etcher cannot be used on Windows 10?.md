This is a known bug, but we found that running Etcher as an administrator on Windows 10 can solve most unstable problems (thanks to Greg for providing this tip). Of course, you can also try to use a not-so-high-value but old-fashioned and more stable programming program, such as [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) or [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).

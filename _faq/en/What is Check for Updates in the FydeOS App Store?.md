Thousands of applications in the FydeOS App Store are available for users to download. Since these apps all come from the Chrome Web Store, the automatic update of apps may not work properly in mainland China. Therefore, we have added a "check for updates" feature in the app store to help users migrate installed Chrome apps to FydeOS apps. There is only one difference between the two, namely the automatic updating URL of the application. After the migration is complete, you can enjoy the convenience of automatic application updates.

Please note that local files and preferences related to your app will not be synchronized after migration. Please make a backup in advance to avoid loss.

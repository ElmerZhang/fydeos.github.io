You can customize the Chromium browser to display any webpage when you open the homepage or startup page. The two web pages are not the same unless you set them to the same web page.

- The startup page is the web page that you see when you start the Chromium browser for the first time on your computer.
- The homepage is the webpage you enter after clicking the "Home" icon.

## Set startup page

You can control the web page displayed when you start Chrome on your computer.

###### 1. Open a new tab

- Select the time in the lower right corner.
- Select the "Settings" icon.
- Under the "Startup" option, select "Open New Tab".

By default, the new tab will display Bing â€™s logo, search bar, and thumbnails of the websites you visit most often. You can also choose an interesting theme for the new tab page.

###### 2. Continue from where you last stopped

- Select the time in the lower right corner.
- Select the "Settings" icon.
- Under "Startup" option, select "Continue from where you last stopped".

Your cookies and data will be saved, so any website you log in at that time will open again.

###### 3. Open a specific webpage or a group of webpages

- Select the time in the lower right corner.
- Select the "Settings" icon.
- Under the "Startup" option, select "Open a specific webpage or a group of webpages".
- Click "Add New Page". Enter the URL and click Add. Or, click "Use Current Page".

## Choose Home

You can control the web page displayed after clicking the "Home" icon.

- Select the time in the lower right corner.
- Select the "Settings" icon.
- Under the "Appearance" option, select "Show Home Button".
- Select "Use New Tab Page" or enter a custom web page.

At this time, the "Home" button will be displayed on the left side of the address bar.

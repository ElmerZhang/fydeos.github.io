By default, the Chromium browser prevents pop-up windows from automatically displaying on the screen.

If the browser blocks a pop-up window, the "Blocked pop-up window" mark will appear in the address bar. You can also allow pop-up windows to be displayed.

## Open or close the pop-up window

1. Select the time in the lower right corner.
2. Select the "Settings" icon.
3. Click "Advanced" at the bottom.
4. Under the "Privacy Settings and Security" option, click "Content Settings".
5. Click "Popups and Redirects".
6. At the top, set the settings to allow or blocked.

## Allow pop-ups for a website

Not all pop-ups are advertising or spam. Some regular websites will display webpage content in pop-up windows.

1. Open the Chromium browser.
2. Go to the webpage where the pop-up is blocked.
3. Click the "Blocked Popup" icon in the address bar.
4. Click the link corresponding to the pop-up window you want to display.
5. To always view the pop-up window of the corresponding website, select "Always allow [site] to display pop-up windows and redirects" and click "Finish".

## Block pop-ups from a website

1. Select the time in the lower right corner.
2. Select the "Settings" icon.
3. Click "Advanced" at the bottom.
4. Under the "Privacy Settings and Security" option, click "Content Settings".

After entering the website URL in the corresponding location, click "Add". To intercept all pop-ups on this site, please use the following format: `[*.]example.com`.

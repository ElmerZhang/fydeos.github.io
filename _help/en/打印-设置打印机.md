You can use FydeOS to print with most printers connected to Wi-Fi or wired networks.

1. Turn on the printer.
2. Connect the printer to the network. If you need help, follow the instructions provided by the printer manufacturer.
3. Log in to FydeOS.
4. Connect the FydeOS device to the network where the printer is located.

Note that you can also use a USB cable to connect the printer to the FydeOS device and then print. With this approach, there is no need to connect to Wi-Fi after the printer is set up.

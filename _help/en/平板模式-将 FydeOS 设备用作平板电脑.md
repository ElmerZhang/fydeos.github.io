Some devices can use the tablet mode after installing FydeOS.

## Switch to tablet mode

Some FydeOS devices can be used as both laptops and tablets. If you own such a device, the on-screen keyboard will automatically open when you flip the screen from the hinge.

**Note**: If you connect the mouse to the FydeOS device, it will switch back to laptop mode.

## Using tablet shortcuts

You can use the tablet buttons to complete some tasks more quickly.
- Take a screenshot: Press the power button and volume down button at the same time.
- Turn off your tablet or log out: Press and hold the power button until the screen displays the shutdown or logout menu.
- Turn off the display: Quickly press the power button and release.
- Use the on-screen keyboard: Tap any text box to display the on-screen keyboard.
- Hide the keyboard: Click anywhere other than the keyboard, and then click the "hide keyboard" icon in the lower right corner of the screen.

## Handwritten text
1. Tap any text box to display the on-screen keyboard.
2. Click the "Handwriting" icon.
3. In the panel that is displayed immediately, use your finger or touch screen stylus to write text.

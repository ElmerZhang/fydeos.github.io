4. Under the "Accessibility" option, click "Manage Accessibility".
5. Under the "Mouse and Trackpad" option, click "Open Mouse and Trackpad Device Settings".
6. Turn on "Enable Click and Drag" and "Enable Click and Click".

To use the press-to-click feature, double-tap and hold the object, and then drag the object.

## Automatically click objects
1. Select the time in the lower right corner, or press `Alt` + `Shift` + `s`.

6. In the "Delay before clicking" drop-down list, select how long you want the FydeOS device to pause before clicking.

To click without pressing the mouse or trackpad, hover over the object you want to click.

## Use keyboard shortcuts (press one key at a time)

2. Click the "Settings" icon.
3. Click "Advanced" at the bottom.

To use sticky keys, press any key that opens the keyboard shortcut: `❖ / ⌘`, `Shift`, `Alt`, or `Ctrl` key.
 - To hold down a key until you complete the keyboard shortcut, press the key twice.
 - To release a key, press the key again.
